    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
          C). Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in
          the oven to melt
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          When butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer over the butter.
          Top evenly with frozen veggies.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the mix, and milk in
          a bowl until well blended; pour over the chicken and veggies. Spread
          lightly and evenly over the top of the mixture but do not stir.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over
          biscuit mix but do not stir.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden brown and only
          very slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand for 10 minutes
          before serving.
