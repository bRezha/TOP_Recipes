    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious.
      Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San
      Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab,
      the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of
      investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.
