    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious.
      Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San
      Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab,
      the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of
      investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Secret Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Noodles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Gather all ingredients. Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire
          sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together in a small
          bowl for the secret sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir
          just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce
          and turn off the heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
          boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm
          to the bite, about 12 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Transfer spaghetti into the sauce using tongs, bringing some of the
          cooking water with it. Toss until well coated; stir in Parmesan
          cheese. Splash in more pasta water if noodles are too dry.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Plate noodles; garnish with green onions and red pepper flakes.</p>
